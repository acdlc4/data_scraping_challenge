# data_scraping_challenge

This coding challenge involves the use Splinter and Beautiful Soup for analysis by web-scraping data directly from public websites.  This process facilitates any analysis by creating data sets that are summarized in a user-friendly format.

This exercise provides two analyses from websites:
- Scraping of titles and summaries from news articles
- Scraping of weather data contained in tables

### Examples of data visualizations created for analysis:

Minimum average temperatures bar chart to easily identify 'hottest' and coldest months on Mars:
![Mars minimum temperatures by month, sorted](https://github.com/acdlc4/data_scraping_challenge/blob/main/output/mars_temps_by_month_sorted.png)

Mars minimum temperatures plot against all available daily data in chronological order:
![Mars minimum temperatures by number of days](https://github.com/acdlc4/data_scraping_challenge/blob/main/output/mars_min_temps_by_no_days.png)

Mars average atmospheric pressure plot by month (lower pressures indicate likelihood of precipitation):
