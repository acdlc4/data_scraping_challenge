# data_scraping_challenge

This coding challenge uses Splinter and Beautiful Soup for the primary reason of scraping data directly from public websites.







Any questions?

Feel free to send a message to acdlc4@gmail.com with any questions / comments / concerns. Inspiration and credit for any code used is from work done during my attendance in the 2024 Northwestern University Data Analysis Bootcamp class sessions.
